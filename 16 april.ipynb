    "- Instances that are misclassified by the current weak learner \\( h_t(x) \\) receive higher weights in the next iteration \\( t+1 \\). This adjustment ensures that subsequent weak learners focus more on these hard-to-classify instances.\n",
    "- The exponential term \\( \\exp(-\\alpha_t \\cdot y_i \\cdot h_t(x_i)) \\) amplifies the weight update for misclassified instances, making AdaBoost increasingly sensitive to difficult examples as the algorithm progresses through iterations.\n",
    "- This iterative process continues for a predefined number of iterations \\( T \\), or until a stopping criterion (e.g., a perfect classification or a maximum number of iterations) is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, AdaBoost updates the weights of misclassified samples by adjusting their weights exponentially to emphasize their importance in subsequent iterations. This strategy effectively directs the boosting process to focus on improving the classification of challenging instances, leading to the creation of a strong ensemble classifier."
